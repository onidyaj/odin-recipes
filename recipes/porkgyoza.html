    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>2 cups ground pork</li>
        <li>2 medium mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Dumpling wrappers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork, mushrooms, garlic, rice wine, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well until it forms a uniform texture.</li>
        <li>Take one round dumpling wrapper and put 2 tbsp of the pork mixture on one side of the wrapper, leaving room at the edges. Brush a thin coat of water along the open space. Fold the wrapper over itself into a semi-circle shape and firmly press down on the edges. Use a fork to crimp the edges. Repeate for remainining gyoza.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in large pan over medium heat. Place the gyoza into the pan in one layer. Allow to cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 4-6 tbsp of water into the pan and cover with a lid. Allow the steam to cook the rest of the gyoza for 3-4 minutes or until the water has evaporated and the meat has cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve by placing a plate upside down over the gyoza, and flipping the entire pan upside down so the plate is right side up. The gyoza should be served brown-side up.</li>
